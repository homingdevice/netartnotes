var x = whateveryoulike
/* later ECMA added
 const x = whateveryoulike -for when you have a variable that is NOT going to change later in code
letx = whateveryoulike for when something is constantly changing throughout your code
*/
in let name = 'maria luisa';
name in this corresponds to a name for storage space in memory

javascript lets u change around type of variable from string to number

the way you create an object in javascript:     s = { age:100, name "maria", location: "chicago"}

to call one piece  of info in that object you write s.age and the return would b 100 etc etc


types of data: undefined, strings, numbers, booleans, objects,

'===' means is the value EXACTLY equal to

array is storing info in [] instead of {}
-also separate values with ,
ex: let primes = [2,3,5,7,11]
primes.length outputs the amount of items in array
primes.shift -- will remove the first item in array
primes.pop --will remove last item in array
primes.unshift --will add item to beginning of array

argv gives us an array of strings


to increment by   1 do: x++
to increment by anything else do: x += 5
